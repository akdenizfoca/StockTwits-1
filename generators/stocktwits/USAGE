Stocktwits Generator
=====================

The Stocktwits generator allows you to generate the components necessary to implement Twitter as a Single Sign-On provider for your site.

To run it, you simply need to call it:

script/generate stocktwits

This will generate the migration necessary for the users table as well as generate a User model that extends the appropriate Stocktwits model template and a config/stocktwits.yml that allows you to set your OAuth consumer key and secret (if required). 

By default, Stocktwits uses Plain as its authentication strategy. If you wish to use HTTP Basic you can pass in the --basic option or OAuth if you pass the -O or --oauth option.
